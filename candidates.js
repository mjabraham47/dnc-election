He is a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, the Minnesota state Democratic Party affiliate", "Vision": "This election cycle, we did not motivate enough people to the ballot box. We must champion working families and give voters a reason to show up at the polls in 2018 and beyond. We must build a bench not just for federal candidates, but for state and local candidates across the nation. We also need a robust party organization in every state that prioritizes voter relationships over everything else. We must invest in and empower our state and local parties by creating effective field operations, an enhanced and advanced voter file, and a culture of collaboration between candidates at every level. Let's put the voters first.", "Platform": "1. PUTTING VOTERS FIRST - We need to prioritize a grassroots focus on voter turnout. PROGRESSIVE PARTNERS: Engage with progressive allies in party rebuilding, including vision and message development, constituency outreach, and grassroots mobilization. BEYOND THE BELTWAY - Elections are won and lost on the ground in states and local communities. STRENGTHENED STATE AND LOCAL PARTIES: Increase State Partnership Project funding to a base of $10,000/month, with additional dedicated funding available for state and local parties to apply for to build programs for core work, with metrics for success. STATE AND LOCAL TOOLKIT: The DNC should provide additional resources to help state and local parties succeed, including: Planning: Assisting with development of political, field and communications plans. Research: Rapid-response research on policy proposals that harm working Americans Technology: Expanded tech tools like standard software apps and website templates to ensure Presidential campaign innovations make it all the way down the ballot 3. FOCUS ON WORKING PEOPLE - Voters must know that Democrats stand for them. LABOR AS A FULL PARTNER: Build meaningful relationships with the labor community as a strategic and tactical partner in the fight for the interests of working people. Commit to using only 100% union hotels, venues and vendors when possible. 4. ACCOUNTABILITY & INCLUSION - DNC stakeholders must have an active voice in shaping our Party. TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION: Open up lines of communication within the Party, ensuring that all have a voice in how their Party operates. This would include monthly calls with state party chairs and regional calls with county parties and local organizations. 5. TECHNOLOGY - Bring innovation and security to all levels of the Party. POLLING AND ANALYTICS POST-MORTEM: Convene a working group to assess polling and analytics from this cycle and create an executable plan to improve performance." },

But now isn’t the time to despair - it’s time to organize and fight. In the years ahead, we must strengthen our team, and our bench, from the ground up. And we must stand up to protect President Obama’s accomplishments. But most of all, we need to listen. We need to listen to Democrats at every level, empowering them to fight for progressive values and a vision of opportunity and optimism. And we need to listen to voters, up and down the ballot, who are asking us to stand behind them. Together, we will build the party every Democrat – and every American – deserves.", "Platform": "FIGHTING FOR OUR VALUES: Standing up for what we believe - from protecting civil rights to creating a level playing field for all Americans -- is a critical part of who we are as progressives and as Democrats. And in this divisive time, we have to unify our party, speak with a loud, clear voice and be heard. GROWING FROM THE GRASSROOTS: The values we share and the message we bring must be driven from the ground up, from organizing to fundraising. Offering more opportunities for donors to support our cause with what they can will help grow our party and spread our message. ADVOCATING IN EVERY ZIP CODE: Zip code should never determine your destiny in this country. And similarly, no matter where they live every American should hear our message of inclusion and opportunity. ORGANIZE FOR OPPORTUNITY: Democrats win when we tell voters who we are, what we value and communicate our message in every community we can. We can’t do that without the best progressive organizers in America. SHARING WHAT WORKS: Our state parties are on the front lines of finding the best candidates for office, reaching out to voters, and delivering our message of inclusion and opportunity for all Americans. This comes with challenges on all levels. But while many states have found answers to what works best, those solutions too often stay in one state. ENSURING A FAIR PROCESS: A fair, transparent, neutral DNC supports our values of inclusion and opportunity. And the role of the DNC is to ensure those values are an unassailable part of the presidential nominating process, from the beginning to the end. USING DATA TO DRIVE OUR MESSAGE: Democrats win when we talk about who we are and what we believe. As voters become less attached to institutions and parties, showing Americans how much our values overlap with theirs and the positive impact a Democratic vote can make on our shared vision for the country becomes even more important. ADVANCING OUR CYBERSECURITY. BUILDING EFFECTIVE, ENDURING PARTNERSHIPS." },

A member of the Democratic Party, Buttigieg has been serving as mayor since January 1, 2012.", "Vision": "The DNC needs new leadership to deliver a fresh start. The solutions we need to rebuild our Party will come from our local communities, our states and territories- not from Washington. The next Democratic chair must speak to the common threads that bring together our diverse constituencies, not be afraid to reach out to new ones, and build a new future for the Party around our shared values.", "Platform": "PUTTING DEMOCRATIC VALUES FIRST: Speak up and defend the values that make us Democrats. In order to win not just elections but the future, the Democratic Party must do what we do best: put forward a compelling economic message that resonates with all working- and middle-class families. Return to the lived experience of Americans. Most Americans aren’t concerned with The Show, with beltway chatter or politicians and their antics. They are concerned with their families, their household budgets, and the safety of those they care about. PUTTING THE FOCUS BACK ON THE STATES: Organize to defend our values in all parts of the country. A 50+ state strategy is necessary but it’s only the beginning. The challenges that face our party are varied and complex, and our solutions must reflect this fact. State-by-state long term planning. The best use of DNC resources is to sponsor and support long-term plans built by state party leadership for their state and territory party organizations. Encourage more flexible models for funding the states. The support state parties receive from the nationwide community of Democrats should not be limited to direct hard federal dollars from the DNC. Connect local resources to national needs, and vice versa. Keeping our promises to build up state and local parties will be expensive, and calls for new funding resources. Perform a comprehensive DNC fundraising audit to create an evidence-based future plan. As with any major organization, strategic planning needs to be informed by strong analytics. We need a comprehensive fundraising audit of the DNC to determine Return on Investment analytics that show what’s working, what isn’t, and what we can do to make fundraising as effective as possible. Develop top-level cybersecurity capabilities. Cybersecurity will be a top issue for party infrastructure from now on. Create Robust Partnerships with Democratic Organizations. The DNC can’t and shouldn’t try to do it all." },

It is clear we have reached a point where we are not being responsive to our members or the public. As uncomfortable as it is, we all need to be bold and challenge the status quo. We are at a crossroads. We can choose to move ourselves past our defeats by looking honestly at the root causes or we can perish as a party. In this place and time, we need to give ourselves permission to take risks and embrace bold solutions that will lead us to victory in the coming years.", "Platform": "We must become a service-based organization designed to meet the needs of our national institutions, 57 state Party organizations, our general membership, and every single citizen who needs an advocate on their behalf. It is imperative that we simultaneously create an insurgency to save democracy, and protect our freedoms. The DNC needs to lead the way on collaborative partnerships that aim to maximize our strengths and resources while minimizing redundancies and waste. State Partnership Program – Our first mission-critical item is to ensure we have the 57 strong, vibrant state Parties to take back statehouses and achieve electoral success at every level of governance. Make Democrats Abroad, D.C. and our 5 territories full partners with equity. Regional desks housed with local offices who work on the following items with their assigned states and Democrats Abroad: Fundraising: Plan and communicate all national visits, call-time support for Chairs, training for fundraising staff, brainstorming ideas, find national surrogates for state party events. Digital: Highlight emerging leaders with an emphasis on the New American Majority to national press, promote positive values-based brand to regional press, relay regional issues to national spokespeople, provide training and support on new technologies. Political: Candidate recruitment, strategic planning, leadership transition training, coordinated campaign planning, troubleshooting, crisis management. Create a more inclusive and broader multiplicity policy in our bylaws and employment manual with behavioral standards that are required for hiring, committee appointments, and participation aimed at creating representation divided by region, that encourages intersectionality, inclusion, and diverse perspectives. Establish the Unity Commission within the first week of taking office as instructed in the 2016 Resolution." },

Every corner of every state would benefit from a stronger state party. Vibrant state parties are essential to winning offices from the municipal level all the way to the White House. In the coming years we have the opportunity to recapture governorships and state legislative majorities, win senate and congressional seats, and create the foundation to win back the White House.

By winning 3 million more votes nationally than the President-elect, we have a clear mandate from the majority of Americans to mount a powerful resistance to his administration, to fight injustice. To do this, the Democratic Party needs to be a constant presence in communities across America -- not just a force that descends every few years at election time.", "Platform": "MY VISION FOR OUR PARTY’S FUTURE: Transformation requires willingness, radical candor and strong change management. We have to inspire with our ideas and then deliver results that matter. In order to rebuild the Democratic Party, we must: PRIORITIZE ONGOING, SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN - AND ENGAGEMENT OF - LOCAL COMMUNITIES, SO THAT WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS BEYOND TWO-YEAR ELECTION CYCLES. MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN STATES WHERE OUR BASE IS RAPIDLY GROWING, EVEN IF THE ELECTORAL PAYOFF ISN’T IMMEDIATE. DEVELOP A ROBUST, DIVERSE PIPELINE OF CANDIDATES EAGER TO ADVANCE OUR PRINCIPLES -- AND SUPPORT THEM WHEN THEY RUN. COMMUNICATE BETTER WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHARE OUR VALUES AND YET AREN’T SHOWING UP TO VOTE BECAUSE THEY FEEL LEFT OUT OF THE PROCESS, SO WE CAN BUILD AN INCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP BASE. BE WARY OF OVERCOMPENSATING FOR STRATEGIC MISTAKES, SO AS NOT TO THROW OUT THE GOOD WITH THE BAD. TAKE A GOOD, HARD LOOK AT OUR ELECTORAL PROCESSES AND MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS CONCERNING SUPERDELEGATES AND OUR PRIMARY CALENDAR. I don’t have all the answers -- no one person does. But as chair, I will be a partner to local party leaders. I will seek out and elevate the best practices from the local level. I will commit resources to building a grassroots army of diverse volunteers, trainers, staff and candidates. I will build a leadership team comprised of the most thoughtful, compassionate, locally-focused group of people around." },

We cannot fall into the trap of relitigating our hard-fought 2016 primary, pointing fingers and placing blame for our general election defeat. We are not Clinton Democrats, Sanders Democrats, or even Obama Democrats—we are all Democrats, and our path forward must focus on the future, not the past. Moving toward 2018 and 2020 united as Democrats, we must reach out to every state, every community, and every voter.Our values are American values, and our policy agenda will improve the lives of all Americans.

Because all voters need Democrats.", "Platform": "Jaime will: Invest in all 50 State Parties (plus those in the territories and Democrats Abroad) by increasing the State Partnership Program to $12,000 a month and easing restrictions on how that money is spent. Provide State Parties with professional and specialized operations, capabilities, and in- kind services on a permanent basis through regional Caucus hubs, i.e., provide political, press, fundraising, and tech staff dedicated to serve state parties in each region. Empower regional Caucuses through joint fundraising and candidate support efforts and ensure Caucuses have dedicated funds to support local candidates and efforts. Work with the FEC and Congress to make sure that super PACs and other political organizations are held to the same standard as State Parties. Build a deep bench of potential Democratic candidates who are connected to their communities on every level by supporting state and national political training fellowships modeled after South Carolina’s James E. Clyburn Political Fellowship. Give young people a seat at the decision table by creating a Vice Chair position for those 35 and younger. Spark a new wave of political technological innovation by creating a tech competition to address party eld and message outreach efforts. Promote and invest in community-based activities and messaging modeled after SC Democrats Care. Establish a surrogate program to assist states and local parties with securing Democratic speakers. Host strategy and message coordination sessions with affiliated groups from the DCCC and DSCC and DGA to DLCC and DMO. Provide financial and legal assistance to State and Local Parties and legislators to stop gerrymandering and challenge gerrymandered districts in court. Fight to end GOP voter suppression and make voting more convenient. Push to get big money out of politics and cultivate small-dollar donors at the national, state, and local levels.
